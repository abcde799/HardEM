This is an implementation of a 'Hard EM' algorithm designed from datasets coming from survival analysis. It takes into account a latent cured subpopulation, and assigns actual (hard) cure labels to censored individuals, whereas noncensored individuals are thought of as not cured, for obvious reasons. The algorithm is implemented using the using Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) algorithm from SciPy, and is contained in the module 'HardEM_0.py'. The input is a collection of rows containing covariates (predictors) for the censored individuals, as well as covariates for the noncensored individuals, and the output is the missing cure labels for the censored individuals. In the file 'naive.py' this output is fed into ordinary logistic regression, by selecting the option 'use_HardEM', in the 'naive_fit" function.

The file 'make_df.py' is used to generate data sets consisting of censored and noncensored individuals for which we know all of the cure labels, so that we can test our algorithm against simpler alternatives such as e.g. populating missing cure labels for censored individuals by guessing a 50% probability of being cured, etc. This is done by removing the known cure labels and comparing the outputs of both algorithms. The notebook 'test_algorithm_scrap.ipynb' contains the results of these tests and shows our algorithm performs better using both accuracy and auc scores as metrics.

Finally, the notebook 'demo_hard_em.ipynb' contains a demo showing how to use our algorithm for a well known real life melanoma dataset. It should be noted our algorithm is used to populate the missing cure labels for the censored individuals, which is then fed into classical logistic regression using Scikit-learn.
